Multilingual / Globalization: URL-based multilanguage; easy translation interface, compatible with WP SEO by Yoast, All in One SEO Pack and ACF!

== Description ==

**WPGlobus** is a plugin for making bilingual / multilingual WordPress blogs and sites.

	* translate major taxonomies: categories and tags;
	* translate menus and widgets;
* Enable multilingual SEO features of:
    * WP SEO by Yoast;
    * All in One SEO Pack by Michael Torbert.
* Translate Custom Fields:
	* standard;
	* created with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
* Switch the languages at the Front using:
	* a drop-down menu extension;
	* a customizable widget with various display options;
* Switch the Administrator interface language using a top bar selector.

The WPGlobus option panel allows for selecting active languages as well as defining custom combinations of country flag and language abbreviation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you support PHP 5.x? =

* We develop using PHP 5.5, and would like everyone to use at least that version.
* PHP 5.2 is highly discouraged. At this stage, we try to follow the WordPress guidelines and do not use any of the 5.3+ features (namespaces, anonymous functions, etc.) - but we do not guarantee that it will be the case in the future releases.
* So, please use PHP 5.5+. Everyone will feel better. Thank you!

= Do you support MSIE / Opera / Safari / Chrome / Firefox - Version x.x? =

* We believe that our CSS and JS run properly on the most recent versions of those browsers.
* We do our best to fix any problems you discover on Chrome, FF and MSIE 11+. Opera and Safari are excluded from our top list, but they should work fine. MSIE 10,9,8,7,etc. - completely ignored (thanks for understanding).

= Do you plan to support subdomains and URL query parameters? =

* WPGlobus does not support switching languages using the `/page/?lang={language}` URLs or subdomains `en.example.com; fr.example.com`. If we see a demand, we may release this functionality in a separate extension. Having it in the core would affect the overall performance.

= I am using WPML (qTranslate, Polylang, Multilingual Press, etc.). Can I switch to WPGlobus? =

* Switching from (m)qTranslate(-X) should be straightforward and smooth if you are using the URLs in the form `/en/page/`, `/fr/page`, etc.
* Switching from other plugins is also possible, but will require some manual work. In the future, we plan to release the transition routines.

= The theme/plugin 'X' I am using does not display the multiple languages correctly. Can you help? =

* If this is a free theme/plugin, available on WordPress.org, written using the WordPress 4.x standards, we'll do our best to find a solution;
* Unfortunately, we cannot help you with any commercial theme of plugin that demonstrates incompatibility with WPGlobus. However, if the theme/plugin's author wishes to contact us and work on the solution together - we'll be very happy to collaborate.

= Do you plan to support WooCommerce, EDD, other e-Commerce plugins? =

* Yes, we do. Currently working on WC. Other plugins will follow.

= How do I contribute to WPGlobus? =

We appreciate all contributions, ideas, critique, and help.

* To speed up our development, please report bugs, with reproduction steps, or post patches on [WPGlobus GitHub](https://github.com/WPGlobus/WPGlobus).
* Plugin and theme authors: please try WPGlobus and let us know if you find any compatibility problems.
* Contact us directly on [WPGlobus.com](http://www.wpglobus.com/contact-us/).
